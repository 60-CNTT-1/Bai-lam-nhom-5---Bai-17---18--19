                    went wrong, and what it might do to recover its good graces.” —Tim Wu, author of The Master Switch</b><br><br>
                    Buying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. 
                    But few of us realize just how many oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares are baked inside the tech products we use every day. It’s time we change that. <br><br>
                    In Technically Wrong, Sara Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the 
                    screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use—and to demand more from the companies behind them. <br><br>
