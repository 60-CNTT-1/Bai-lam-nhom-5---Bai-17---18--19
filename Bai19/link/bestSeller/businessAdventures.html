                <p class="_contentBook"><b>“Business Adventures remains the best business book I’ve ever read.” —Bill Gates, The Wall Street Journal</b><br><br>
                    What do the $350 million Ford Motor Company disaster known as the Edsel, the fast and incredible rise of Xerox, and the unbelievable scandals at General Electric and Texas Gulf Sulphur have in common? 
                    Each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety; these notable and fascinating accounts 
                    are as relevant today to understanding the intricacies of corporate life as they were when the events happened. <br><br>

                    Stories about Wall Street are infused with drama and adventure and reveal the machinations and volatile nature of the world of finance. 
                    Longtime New Yorker contributor John Brooks’s insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, 
                    or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history repeats itself. <br><br>

                    Five additional stories on equally fascinating subjects round out this wonderful collection that will both entertain and inform readers . . . 
                    Business Adventures is truly financial journalism at its liveliest and best.
