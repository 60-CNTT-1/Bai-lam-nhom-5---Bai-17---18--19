                <p class="_contentBook"><b>The one primer you need to develop your leadership skills.</b>
                    <br><br>

                    Put aside all the overhyped new frameworks, the listicles, the "10 best things you need to succeed 
                    as a leader today." The critical leadership practices--the ones that will allow a leader to make the 
                    biggest impact over time--are well established. They're about how you create a vision and inspire others 
                    to follow it. How you make difficult strategic choices. How you lead innovation. How you get results. 
                    These fundamental skills are even more important today as organizations and teams become increasingly 
                    networked, virtual, agile, fast-moving, and socially conscious.
                    <br><br>

                    In this comprehensive handbook, strategy and change experts Ron Ashkenas and Brook Manville distill 
                    proven ideas and frameworks about leadership from Harvard Business Review, interviews with senior 
                    executives, and their own experience in the field--all to help rising leaders stand out and have a big impact.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
