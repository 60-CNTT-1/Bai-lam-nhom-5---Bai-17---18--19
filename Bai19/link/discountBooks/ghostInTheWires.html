                    most famous hacker teaches you easy cloaking and counter-measures for citizens and consumers in 
                    the age of Big Brother and Big Data (Frank W. Abagnale).</b>

                    Kevin Mitnick was the most elusive computer break-in artist in history. He accessed computers and 
                    networks at the world's biggest companies -- and no matter how fast the authorities were, Mitnick 
                    was faster, sprinting through phone switches, computer systems, and cellular networks. As the FBI's 
                    net finally began to tighten, Mitnick went on the run, engaging in an increasingly sophisticated 
                    game of hide-and-seek that escalated through false identities, a host of cities, and plenty of close 
                    shaves, to an ultimate showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down.

                    Ghost in the Wires is a thrilling true story of intrigue, suspense, and unbelievable escapes -- 
                    and a portrait of a visionary who forced the authorities to rethink the way they pursued him, and 
                    forced companies to rethink the way they protect their most sensitive information.
