                    By day he made thousands of dollars a minute. By night he spent it as fast as he could. 
                    From the binge that sank a 170-foot motor yacht and ran up a $700,000 hotel tab, to the 
                    wife and kids waiting at home and the fast-talking, hard-partying young stockbrokers who 
                    called him king, here, in Jordan Belfort’s own words, is the story of the ill-fated genius 
                    they called the Wolf of Wall Street. In the 1990s, Belfort became one of the most infamous 
                    kingpins in American finance: a brilliant, conniving stock-chopper who led his merry mob on 
                    a wild ride out of Wall Street and into a massive office on Long Island. It’s an extraordinary 
                    story of greed, power, and excess that no one could invent: the tale of an ordinary guy who 
                    went from hustling Italian ices to making hundreds of millions—until it all came crashing down.
