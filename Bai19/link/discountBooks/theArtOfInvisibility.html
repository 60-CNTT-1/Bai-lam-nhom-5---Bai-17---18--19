                <p class="_contentBook">Be online without leaving a trace. Your every step online is being tracked 
                    and stored, and your identity literally stolen. Big companies and big governments want to know 
                    and exploit what you do, and privacy is a luxury few can afford or understand.
                    <br><br>
                    In this explosive yet practical book, Kevin Mitnick uses true-life stories to show exactly 
                    what is happening without your knowledge, teaching you "the art of invisibility" -- online 
                    and real-world tactics to protect you and your family, using easy step-by-step instructions.
                    <br><br>
                    Reading this book, you will learn everything from password protection and smart Wi-Fi usage 
                    to advanced techniques designed to maximize your anonymity. Kevin Mitnick knows exactly how vulnerabilities 
                    can be exploited and just what to do to prevent that from happening.
                    <br><br>
                    The world's most famous -- and formerly the US government's most wanted -- computer hacker, 
                    he has hacked into some of the country's most powerful and seemingly impenetrable agencies and companies, 
                    and at one point was on a three-year run from the FBI. Now Mitnick is reformed and widely regarded as the 
                    expert on the subject of computer security. Invisibility isn't just for superheroes; privacy is a power you 
					deserve and need in the age of Big Brother and Big Data.</p>
