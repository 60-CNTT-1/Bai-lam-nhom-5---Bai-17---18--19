                <p class="_contentBook">Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development 
                    organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because 
                    of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.
                    <br><br>

                    Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook 
                    of <b>Agile Software Craftsmanship</b> . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill 
                    their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values 
                    of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.

                    What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged 
                    to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be 
                    hallenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.

                    <b>Clean Code</b> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and 
                    practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. 
                    Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems 
                    into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing 
                    a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge 
                    base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.
